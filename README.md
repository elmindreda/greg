# GREG

GREG is a code generator that produces an OpenGL core and extension function API
loader library tailored to your needs.  It is primarily inspired by flexGL and
is lovingly sculpted from a block of pure frustration with the large number of
promising and yet ultimately unusable loader generators we currently have.

GREG is licensed under the 
[zlib/libpng license](http://opensource.org/licenses/Zlib), which can be found
in the `COPYING.md` file.  The license is also included at the top of each
source file.

GREG is not yet usable.  Go away.  Come back later when it works.
